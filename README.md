# Python - SQL Data Ingestion and Data Management

This repository documents the outcomes of Stage 1 (data collection) and Stage 2 (Data Management).

a.	Data collection
The aim of this stage is to collect all the data from Yanshan refinery that will be used in the project. The predicted deliverables:
- files with measurements of flow rate, temperature and pressure (on company's server)
- files with laboratory measurements for product quality (on company's server)
- files with diagrams for Yanshanâ€™s CDU (VDU and ADU) (on GitHub)
- a Python code for data ingestion (on GitHub)

b.	Data management (to be finished, i.e. put together)
Data storage is a crucial part of data science project. It assures continuous accessibility but also stability over time, reducing reliance on the local machine memory. It also speeds up machine learning by storing only necessary data. The aim of this stage is to create an SQL server and ingest the data on it, which will be used throughout the whole project. The predicted deliverables: 
- SQL server up and running
- measurements and laboratory measurements ingested into the database
- a Python code prepared for data importing from flat files onto SQL server
- a Python code for endpoints connectivity
